**deTube Channel Blocker** is a userscript to hide any videos from specific YouTube channels from ever appearing in your feed.
It adds a "ðŸš« Block Channel" option to YouTube's menu so you can instantly block a channel without leaving the page.

## Why use it?

* **Block channels directly from the video menu** (three-dot menu)
* **No reloads required**, videos disappear immediately
* **Saves your preferences** using your browser's local storage
* **Very lightweight**, uses dynamic CSS rules instead of heavy DOM manipulation
* **Works across YouTube surfaces** including mobile, music, and embeds

## How the script works

This userscript injects a custom "Block Channel" option into YouTube's menu system.
When clicked, the selected channel is added to your personal blocklist and all its videos are hidden automatically.

- Videos are tagged on load with their channel name
- A CSS rule is generated to hide any element matching a blocked channel
- The script observes new content (e.g. infinite scroll) and applies the same logic
- Your blocklist is saved persistently using `GM_setValue`

## Supported Browsers

- Firefox
- Edge
- ~~Chrome~~
- Brave
- Safari
